# Matching images using [SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity_index_measure)

This code is written to match images from high quality source and low quality source - in this case this is DVD and Blu-Ray. Because framerate in DVD is 29.97 fps and in Blu-Ray is 23.976 fps, framerates can't always be matched properly, they sometimes are in sync but sometimes aren't. This code does automatical matching of frames using [SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity_index_measure) as implemented in [PyTorch Image Quality (PIQ)](https://piq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
